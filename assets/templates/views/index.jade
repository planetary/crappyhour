      p Creative happy hour is a response to the collective feeling in New York that we all hve first-rate friends that we don't get to see nearly often enough; even less frequently do our first-rate friend get to meet one another. Every month we designate a time and place to bring people together.
      h4 The next #crappyhour is June 22nd, 6-8pm at <a href="#">One Mile House.</a>
